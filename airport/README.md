# Simulation of an Airport

Programming language: C++

Exercises set A

Exercise 2

## Short description

The airport sets a number of departing flights with specific destinations and departure time. Passengers who wish to travel fill in an application form in which they declare their destination as well as the desirable time of arrival. The airport decides to which flight the passenger will be added. The airport works on a spesific timetable and has an active current time. Flights take off only during its operation.

## Notes

* Open ["flights"](https://github.com/gkoursiounis/cpp/blob/master/airport/flights) and ["applications"](https://github.com/gkoursiounis/cpp/blob/master/airport/applications) files using pico in linux. You may use notepad by "Open with"->"Notepad" in windows
* [main.cpp](https://github.com/gkoursiounis/cpp/blob/master/airport/main.cpp) file is a demo

## How to run
Compile:
```
g++ main.cpp airport_member_functions.cpp flight_member_functions.cpp  application_member_functions.cpp
```
Run. Type the time units the airport is operative:
```
./a.out <time>
```
